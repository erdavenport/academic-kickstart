# ASHG Training and Development Committee

<img style="margin: 10px; float: left" src="/img/ashg_logo.png" width="150">

I've been a member of the [American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) Training and Development Committee (TDC)](https://www.ashg.org/about/tdcomm.shtml) since January 2017. 
Our goal as a society committee is to serve the needs of our trainee members (graduate students and postdocs). 
We provide trainee-related content at the annual meeting (career panels, workshops, networking events, etc.), community building throughout the year, and promoting trainee science.

In particular, I helped organize several events at the [ASHG 2017](http://www.ashg.org/2017meeting/) annual meeting in Orlando, including [ASHG Peer Networking Trivia](http://www.ashg.org/2017meeting/pages/trainees.shtml) and the [ASHG Trainee Professional Development Program: Academic Careers Panel: Open Q&A with Leading Scientists](http://www.ashg.org/2017meeting/asp/soe/webroot/soe.shtml#?search=professional).

For [ASHG 2018](http://www.ashg.org/2018meeting/) in San Diego, I'm leading efforts to organize the ASHG Peer Networking Trivia, [ASHG Trainee Professional Development Program: Resilience and Academic Training](http://www.ashg.org/2018meeting/asp/soe/webroot/soe.shtml), and the [Trainee Paper Spotlight CoLab](http://www.ashg.org/2018meeting/asp/soe/webroot/soe.shtml).

In addition to events for the annual meetings, my year-round activities include leading the [Trainee Paper Spotlight working group of the TDC](https://www.ashg.org/education/Trainee_PaperSpotlight.shtml) and co-leading the [Twitter #ASHGtrainee working group](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ASHGtrainee&src=typd).

# Cornell Consensual Relationships Policy Committee

<img style="margin: 10px; float: left" src="/img/cornell.gif" width="150">

I served as a postdoctoral representative on the university-level committee at Cornell to recommend a [new policy for consensual relationships](https://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/news/consensual-relationships-policy-committee/) on campus. 
This committee consisted of selected representatives of groups on campus (undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, etc.) who had the goal of drafting an updated policy for consensual relationships to mitigate conflict and protect academic integrity and freedom.
After researching similar policies at other institutions and dialog with groups on campus, we submitted a [full policy proposal](http://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/news/consensual-relationships-policy-committee/a-proposed-consensual-relationships-policy/) on May 1, 2018 to the University President. 
Martha Pollock [endorsed our proposed policy](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/05/president-endorses-consensual-relationship-policy), which is expected to roll out in the fall. 

# MBG Postdoc Invited Seminar Series

<img style="margin: 10px; float: left" src="/img/cornell.gif" width="150">

In 2017, [Sarah Lower](https://sesander.wordpress.com/), [Anne-Marie Dion-Côté](https://amdioncote.weebly.com/), and I initiated a new departmental committee who organized postdoc-invited speakers as part of the [Molecular Biology and Genetics (MBG)](https://mbg.cornell.edu/) [seminar series](https://mbg.cornell.edu/sites/mbg.cornell.edu/files/shared/17-18%20combined.pdf). 
Our goal was to increase the diversity of speakers included in our departmental seminar series, target speakers with reputations of being trainee-oriented, and providing extra chances for trainees in the department to network with invited speakers. 
Our first two visits in 2017 were an overwhelming success, with Dr. Harmit Malik and Dr. Abby Dernburg as our invited speakers.

# Cornell University Postdoc advisory council

<img style="margin: 10px; float: left" src="/img/cornell.gif" width="150">

Starting in 2016, I joined the [Cornell University Postdoctoral Advisory Council](https://postdocs.cornell.edu/postdoc-advisory-committee).
This cross-campus council seeks to provide support, networking, and professional development opportunities to the large number of postdocs at Cornell. 
During my time on the committee, I led the effort to create a Postdoc Welcome packet for all new incoming postdocs to campus, and helped to organize a monthly social night.
