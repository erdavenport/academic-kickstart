## Classroom

I never thought I would enjoy teaching, but after TAing several classes at UChicago I realized that I _loved_ it.   

To delve into it (as much as one can as a graduate student) I earned a certificate in University Teaching from the [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://teaching.uchicago.edu/) at UChicago (now called Chicago Center for Teaching). 
This involved participating in a number of seminars and workshops related to designing curricula and assessment, generating a teaching portfolio, and being critiqued while teaching.   

I even taught part of a course during my final year as a graduate student, covering topics in genomics such as current sequencing technology and applications, basic statistics, and genome organization and function. 
For an example of some prepared course material, see my [introduction to linear models in R](/img/linear_models_in_R_no_answers_041014ERD.html) material. A summary of my TA evaluations can be found [here](/img/TA_feedback.pdf).

To continue gaining experience as a teacher as a postdoc, I'm participating in workshops offered by the [Center for Teaching Excellence at Cornell](http://www.cte.cornell.edu/) and [Cornell University Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CU-CIRTL)](http://gradschool.cornell.edu/cu-cirtl). 
I've completed certificate programs in the [Postdoc Leadership Program](http://postdocs.cornell.edu/professional-development), [Building Mentoring Skills for an Academic Career](http://gradschool.cornell.edu/cu-cirtl/mentoring-program), and [The Practice of Inclusive Teaching in STEM](http://gradschool.cornell.edu/cu-cirtl/inclusive-series).
See my [CV](img/ERD_CV.pdf) for a full list of completed programs. 
Additionally, I've kept active in the classroom by teaching at Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops (see below).

<img style="margin: 10px; float: left" src="../img/instructor.png" width="125" height="125">

During graduate school I went to a Software Carpentry bootcamp and in two days learned all of the things I was hoping to learn about being a computational scientist (ok, it's taking _a lot_ more than two days, but the seeds were planted!). 
I became a certified [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) instructor in 2013 and taught at my first [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) workshop in 2015. 
I've been an instructor at 8 workshops (in Chicago, Ithaca, and State College) and lead instructor at 3 (in Toronto, Ithaca, and Phoenix), typically teaching the shell, git, and/or R. 
It's a great community and I'm constantly learning new skills (for instance, how to make this webpage using jekyll and github).

#### <span style="color:black" class="align_left">Adon Chowdhury (2017 -    ) </span>
<span style="color:black" class="align_left">Biometry and Statistics Undergraduate in the [Clark Lab](http://blogs.cornell.edu/clarklabblog/) @ Cornell University</span>

Adon was a Biometry and Statistics major (graduated Spring 2018) who became interested in combining his interests in biology and data science by studying the microbiome. 
He is currently leading a project examining whether the dynamics of microbial community assembly in the gut are influenced by host genetics, using samples from the large TwinsUK cohort. 
Adonâ€™s background has proven perfect for this project, as it requires strong statistical and computational skills, along with broad biological understanding.

Trang is a Human Biology, Health, and Society major who became interested in the two-way relationship between the microbiome and the human host after taking courses in microbiology and ecology at Cornell. 
She has contributed to a number of projects during her time in lab, including examining the role of host genetics in microbial community assembly and the role of microbial networks in health and disease.

<span style="color:black" class="align_left">Biology Undergraduate in the [Perry Lab](http://www.anthgenomicslab.com/) @ Pennsylvania State University</span>

Monica became interested in host-microbiome dynamics during coursework for her Biology major. 
During her time in the [Perry Lab](http://www.anthgenomicslab.com/) at Penn State, she examined whether termite-eating behavior in chimpanzees results in the transfer of termite microbiota into the chimpanzee gut. 
I've mentored her on both the wet lab and computational aspects of analyzing 16S rRNA sequencing data.

Xiaoling is interested in the population structure of Japanese Eels, an important aquaculture species in Asia. 
During her time as a visiting scientist in the [Clark Lab](http://blogs.cornell.edu/clarklabblog/), I've been mentoring her on the use of bioinformatic tools for analyzing RADseq data and application of population genetic statistics to answer the open question of whether Japanese Eels are panmictic.
